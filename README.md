  # Description

  Sometimes, you just need to write some stuff down. With this application, all you need to do is enter in a title and what you need done - and boom! Easy notes taken easily.

  ## Installation

  [Visit the application on heroku here](https://note-taker-devin-amlen-5465309faf2a.herokuapp.com).

  ## Usage

  You can enter a title and text for your note. Once you have done both, you can save the note by clicking on the save button that appears in the top right. Alternatively, you can start a new note by clicking the plus. When saved, a note will appear on the left side of the screen, alongside a delete button. Clicking the delete button will, of course, delete the note.
